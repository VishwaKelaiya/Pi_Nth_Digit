Learning from this program:

-	Learnt Ramanujan series for Pi, Also Checked out Chudnovsky series for the same
-	Decimal module and its methods
-	Math module and its methods
-	This program works well till N = 10000 after that it is taking so much time to display output.
-	getcontext().prec max is set upto 425000000
